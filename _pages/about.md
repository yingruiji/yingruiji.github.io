* _**IrGEMM: An Input-Aware Tuning Framework for Irregular GEMM on ARM and X86 CPUs**_

	10/2022 - 04/2023

    * Generated hundreds of highly optimized assembly kernels for diverse irregular GEMM types based on computing templates, the instruction mapping rules between templates and assembly codes, and pipeline optimization strategies.
    * Abstracted tiling problems of GEMM into boxing problems that utilizes dynamic programming approach to minimum memory access of Irregular GEMM and maximum computational memory access ratio.
